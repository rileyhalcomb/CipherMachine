## Introduction
The cipher machine is designed to create a basic understanding of how ciphers function. This application was created for expanding our knowledge on ciphers and how they can be used to encrypt and decrypt text.

**Disclaimer:** This application is intended for educational purposes only. The use of this software for any malicious or unauthorized activities is strictly prohibited. The author(s) do not condone or support illegal activities.

## Features
1. Encrypting and decrypting with a simple cipher.
2. Simple key and cipher for basic cipher cracking.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile and run the application on host machine.
3. Input text and key to encrypt the text.
